# GUI-Based-Face-Recognition-System
By using libraries such as PySimpleGUI, I will develop a face recognition system with a graphical user interface(GUI)
At the database.txt, this is the file based on my data and images, you must create your own new database.txt and a new empty folder called 'data' !!!
In the folder 'Update face recognition', there is a new way to recognize face without using Train method instead I use 'Update' and you dont need to read the .yml format file
